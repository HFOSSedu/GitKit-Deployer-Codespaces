    Location of the new repository
    ------------------------------

    We'll create the new repository that will become the upstream repository
    that you will share with your class. The new repository will be created
    at a URL with the following form:

        https://github.com/OWNER/NAME
    "

  - GITKIT_DOCKER_TAG:
      if-empty:
      value: latest

  - ORG_NAME:
      if-empty:
      description: |
      
        The OWNER can be your personal account on GitHub, or it may
        be an organization for your course on GitHub that you write
        permissions for. It must already exist.

      prompt: "Please enter the OWNER of the new repository: "
      validator:
        regex: "^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$"
        tip: |

          Rules:
          - Only alphanumeric and dash characters.

  - REPO_NAME:
      if-empty:
      description: |
      
        The NAME of the new repository can be any name you like.
        We recommed GitKit-FarmData2. If you need to create multiple
        instances for your class, you can suffix this name for each
        group: e.g., GitKit-FarmData2-Group1, GitKit-FarmData2-Group2, etc.
        You'll need to rerun this deployer for each instance you want
        to create.

      prompt: "Please enter the NAME of the new repository: "
      validator:
        regex: "^[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]+$"
        tip: |

          Rules:
          - Only alphanumeric, underscore, dash, and dot characters.

      default: GitKit-FarmData2

  - REPO_URL: "https://github.com/${ORG_NAME}/${REPO_NAME}"

  - GH_TOKEN:
      description: |+

        Personal Access token
        ---------------------

        To create the repository, we need a personal access token
        with appropriate permissions.

        Navigate to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

        Generate a token that expires in 7 days with the following scopes
            repo (all)
            workflow
            read:org (under admin:org)

      prompt: "Please paste the token you generated (input is not displayed): "
      secret: True
      validator:
        regex: "^(gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}|github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9]{22}_[A-Za-z0-9]{59})$"
        tip: |+

          Common problems...
          * You did not paste your PAT. Maybe your keyboard focus was in a different frame?
          * You may have pasted your PAT multiple times.

          What to do about it...
          1. Copy your PAT from GitHub again (it's OK if you need to generate a new one.)
          2. Return here and click into the terminal to give it the focus.
          3. Press CTRL+V (CMD+SHIFT+V on Mac) and press enter.
          4. If you get this same message again,
             instead try CTRL+SHIFT+V (CMD+SHIFT+V on Mac) and press enter.

    To Create Another
    -----------------

    If you need to create another, you can open a new terminal (CTRL+SHIFT+~)
    and run the deployer again:

        .devcontainer/deploy.bash

    A Short Survey for Research
    ---------------------------

    As part of our NSF-funded project, we are gathering information on the use of GitKit.
    If you are currently integrating GitKit into a course you are instructing,
    we kindly request your participation in this brief survey:
